# ROADMAP.md

**Status:** Phase 1 complete (Feb 27, 2026). Session 2 improvements complete (Mar 2, 2026) — M2/PR1/PR4 implemented, Phase 2 scaffold created, 53 invariant tests passing + 7 skipped (Phase 2 parquets pending) + 7 AC.

**Legend:**
- Status: ✅ Complete · ⬜ Open · 🔄 In progress
- Effort: Low (<1 day) · Medium (1–3 days) · High (>3 days)
- Phase 1.5 = before next milestone; Phase 2–4 = alongside/after named milestone

## Section 1 — Active Milestones (Phases 2–4)

| # | Milestone | Status | Scripts | Revenue models unlocked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Beneish M-Score screen | ✅ Complete (Feb 2026) | `beneish_screen.py` | All |
| 2 | CB/BW timelines | 🔄 In progress (scaffold created Mar 2, 2026; 5 gaps remain — see 28_Phase2_Development_Status.md) | `cb_bw_timelines.py` | #1, #3, #4, #8, #9 |
| 3 | Timing anomalies | ⬜ Planned | `timing_anomalies.py` | #3, #4, #5, #9 |
| 4 | Officer network | ⬜ Planned | `officer_network.py` | #2, #3, #4, #9 |
| 5 | Continuous monitoring (3-way match) | ⬜ Planned | `monitoring/` (new dir) | #3, #4, #5, #9 |

Revenue model numbers reference `00_Reference/00_Feature_Analysis.md` Section 4 priority matrix.

> Phase 5 is the first milestone requiring a persistent hosted process (daemon). It
> depends on Phases 2 and 3 producing a stable watchlist. Infrastructure decision
> (Railway vs. Oracle Cloud VPS) is documented in `20_Cloud_Infrastructure_Setup.md`.
